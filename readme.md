# 🛡️ Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## Overview
This project implements a **modular Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** designed for educational and research purposes. It performs **packet inspection**, analyzing both **headers** and **payloads** to detect anomalies, suspicious patterns, and potential attacks.  

The system is built with **Python** and leverages libraries like **Scapy** for packet capture and analysis. Its architecture emphasizes **clean code organization**, **extensibility**, and **cross-platform compatibility**.
